# Ishraf Shafiq Zainuddin - Software Systems Engineering Graduate and Junior Front End Developer

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zainshafiq, welcome to the readme file about me! In this document, you'll learn about my background as a Software Systems Engineering graduate and my role as a Junior Front End Developer at REKA, an R&D company based in Malaysia. Let's dive in!

## Background

I am a Software Systems Engineering graduate from the University of Regina in Saskatchewan, Canada. Currently, I am working at REKA, where our primary focus is delivering digital technologies and automation solutions to organizations.

## Skills and Experience

Here are some key points that highlight my skills and experience:

- **Front End Architecture:** I have hands-on experience working with front end architectures to support user interface concepts in client-based microservices projects. I am well-versed in using popular tools and technologies such as ReactJS, Node, and Python to build robust and scalable web applications.

- **No-SQL Databases and Agile Development:** I am familiar with No-SQL databases, specifically Google Firebase. I have experience working with agile development methodologies, allowing for iterative and efficient development cycles. Additionally, I am well-versed in version control practices, ensuring code quality and collaboration among team members.

- **Test Case Preparation:** Taking charge of preparing User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and System Integration Testing (SIT) test cases is one of my responsibilities. I have a keen eye for detail and ensure comprehensive test coverage to validate the software's functionality and meet the requirements.

- **Testing and Code Deployment:** I conduct initial tests in collaboration with my direct supervisor and senior developers before deploying code to production. This helps identify and resolve any issues or bugs, ensuring a seamless and error-free deployment process.

- **Code Debugging, Prototyping, and Documentation:** I possess skills in code debugging, enabling me to identify and fix issues within the codebase. I am proficient in both low-fidelity (lo-fi) and high-fidelity (hi-fi) prototyping techniques, allowing for effective visualization and refinement of user interfaces. Furthermore, I prioritize clear and concise documentation, ensuring that vital information is captured and shared effectively.

- **Jest and Selenium WebDriver Testing:** Currently, I am exploring Jest and Selenium WebDriver for testing functionality. These tools enable me to automate tests and ensure the reliability and quality of web applications.
